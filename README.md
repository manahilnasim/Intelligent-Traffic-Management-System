# Intelligent-Traffic-Management-System

## Project Description
The ITMS project is an innovative solution designed to tackle urban traffic congestion using a network of IoT sensors, edge computing, and machine learning algorithms. The system collects real-time traffic data, analyzes it to predict traffic patterns, and optimizes signal timings to enhance traffic flow and reduce congestion. The repository contains all the development files, including datasets, analysis notebooks, and the machine learning models used in the project. The goal is to provide city planners and traffic managers with advanced tools for real-time traffic analysis and signal optimization, ultimately improving the commute for city dwellers.

## Repository Contents

- `Intelligent Traffic Management System Report`: The comprehensive report detailing the project's scope, methodology, and findings.
- `Data.csv`: The dataset used in the project, encompassing traffic counts across multiple urban junctions.
- `Exploratary Analysis and Data Cleaning.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that walks through the initial data analysis and preprocessing steps.
- `Deep Learning Model Final new.ipynb`: The final version of the Deep Learning model used for predicting traffic patterns.
- `Time Series Model.ipynb`: The Time Series model developed to forecast future traffic trends.
- `Tableau Dashboard`: A visualization tool developed in Tableau to present insights and predictions from the models.
